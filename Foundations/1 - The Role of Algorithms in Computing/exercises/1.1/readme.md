> **_3. Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations\._**

[Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array/)
_Pros :-_

- independent or random access - _O(1)_

_Cons :-_

- fixed size
- insertion is costly - _O(n)_
- deletion is costly - _O(n)_

> **_5. Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough\._**
