> **_2. Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=8 * n* n"> steps, while merge sort runs in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=64*{n%20lgn}"> steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?_**

> **_3. What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=100 * n* n"> runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{n}"> on the same machine?_**
